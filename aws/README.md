# Setup your secrets in AWS

In this setup we integrate the secrets-exercise online with AWS EKS and let Pods consume secrets from the AWS Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager.
We use managed node groups so as we don't want the hassle of managing the EC2 instances ourselves, and Fargate doesn't suit our needs since we use a StatefulSet. If you want to know more about integrating secrets with EKS, check [EKS and SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/integrating_csi_driver.html) and [EKS and Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/integrating_csi_driver.html).

## Pre-requisites

Have the following tools installed:

- AWS CLI - [Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- EKS CTL - [Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)
- Tfenv (Optional) - [Installation](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)
- Terraform CLI - [Installation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- Wget - [Installation](https://www.jcchouinard.com/wget/)
- Helm [Installation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- Kubectl [Installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- jq [Installation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

Make sure you have an active account at AWS for which you have configured the credentials on the system where you will execute the steps below. In this example we stored the credentials under an aws profile as `awsuser`.

## Installation

The terraform code is loosely based on [this EKS managed Node Group TF example](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/tree/master/examples/managed_node_groups).

**Note**: Applying the Terraform means you are creating cloud infrastructure which actually costs you money. The authors are not responsible for any cost coming from following the instructions below.

**Note-II**: The cluster you create has its access bound to the public IP of the creator. In other words: the cluster you create with this code has its access bound to your public IP-address if you apply it locally.

1. export your AWS credentials (`export AWS_PROFILE=awsuser`)
2. check whether you have the right profile by doing `aws sts get-caller-identity` and make sure you have enough rights with the caller its identity and that the actual accountnumber displayed is the account designated for you to apply this TF to.
3. Do `terraform init` (if required, use tfenv to select TF 0.13.1 or higher )
4. Do `terraform plan`
5. Do `terraform apply`. Note: the apply will take 10 to 20 minutes depending on the speed of the AWS backplane.
6. When creation is done, do `aws eks update-kubeconfig --region eu-west-1 --name wrongsecrets-exercise-cluster --kubeconfig ~/.kube/wrongsecrets`
7. Do `export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/wrongsecrets`
8. Run `./k8s-vault-aws-start.sh`

Your EKS cluster should be visible in [EU-West-1](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home?region=eu-west-1#/clusters) by default. Want a different region? You can modify `terraform.tfvars` or input it directly using the `region` variable in plan/apply.

Are you done playing? Please run `terraform destroy` twice to clean up.

### Test it

Run `AWS_PROFILE=<your_profile> k8s-vault-aws-start.sh` and connect to http://localhost:8080 when it's ready to accept connections (you'll read the line `Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080` in your console). Now challenge 9 and 10 should be available as well.

### Clean it up

When you're done:

1. Kill the port forward.
2. Run `terraform destroy` to clean up the infrastructure.
3. Run `unset KUBECONFIG` to unset the KUBECONFIG env var.
4. Run `rm ~/.kube/wrongsecrets` to remove the kubeconfig file.
5. Run `rm terraform.ts*` to remove local state files.

### A few things to consider

1. Does your worker node now have access as well?
2. Can you easily obtain the instance profile of the Node?
3. Can you get the secrets in the SSM Parameter Store and Secrets Manager easily? Which paths do you see?
4. Which of the 2 (SSM Parameter Store and Secrets Manager) works cross-account?
5. If you have applied the secrets to the cluster, you should see at the configuration details of the cluster that Secrets encryption is "Disabled", what does that mean?
