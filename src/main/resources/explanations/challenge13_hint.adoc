You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Exfiltrate the secret using Github Actions. Please note that in the current configuration of the project the Action triggered by the owner/collaborator will include the secret. It will not if you try doing it using forks. Let's discuss the steps:
- Go to https://github.com/commjoen/wrongsecrets/actions and select `Get the challenge code 13`
- Have a look at its latest run by one of the owners or collaborators.
- Take the last attempt of the run, where the secret is base64 encoded. Copy the base64 encoded result and decode it somewhere.
- Enter the decoded solution as an answer.
