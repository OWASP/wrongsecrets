=== Challenge 10: AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager part 2

The secret is now randomized and stored directly in the cloud's Secret(s) manager. We're still mounting it to the K8s pod via the https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io[CSI driver] for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/integrating_csi_driver.html[AWS] or https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-gcp[GCP] though... Can you access it?
