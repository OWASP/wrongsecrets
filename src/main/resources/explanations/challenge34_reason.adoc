*Why Key Derivation Functions are not safe when using hardcoded values*

Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) are deterministic. This means that they will always give back the same output for a given input. So, if the parameters are hardcoded, anyone with access to the code can run the KDF with the specified parameters and get the key.

KDFs should be used to generate keys based on dynamic input, such as human-supplied passwords. KDFs might be used when secure random sources can be used to generate keys. Again, the KDF's input is not hardcoded/deterministic in both cases.
