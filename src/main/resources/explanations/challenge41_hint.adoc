This challenge can be solved by decrypting the base64 encoded secret in `secrchallenge.json`. You can do this either by:

1. Using an online aes decryption tool like https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption[https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption]
- Copy the value of `secret` from `secrchallenge.json` and paste it into the textbox of the decryptor.
- Ensure the input format is `Base64` and the cipher mode is `ECB`.
- Use the value of `key` from `secrchallenge.json` as decryption key and click on `Decrypt` to get the secret.

2. Using the terminal
- Launch the terminal while you are in the `maven` directory.
- Copy the value of `password` from `settings.xml`.
