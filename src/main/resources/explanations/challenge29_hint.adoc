As the text of the challenge says, we are looking for the secret in a `screenshot` of a `closed GitHub issue` on our GitHub repository. But how do we find it?

You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Go to our GitHub's `issues` tab, then the closed section, to get all the closed issues.

2. Go through all the Bug reports and look specifically at `screenshots` posted by users.
