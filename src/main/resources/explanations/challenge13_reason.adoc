Why you need to be careful with CI/CD and secrets

When you use CI/CD tooling, you often need to let the tooling (e.g. runner/agent which executes a job) use some sort of secret to authenticate to a secondary service. When this is required, it can become quite interesting to try exfiltrating these secrets.

Why Crypto is still very hard

As you can tell at the Challenge13 source-code: we selected a pre-defined IV. This was done in order to make sure we would end up with the same ciphertext every time.
One could argue that this is a bad shape of https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_CheatSheet.md#72-convergent-encryption[Convergent Encryption].
This has a benefit: you can now tell whether a secret has changed if you have a fixed key and IV. However, this will get you into trouble if secrets are too short, so that you end up with a collision when trying to find the plain-text by encrypting various plaintext pieces hoping to end up with the same ciphertext.
