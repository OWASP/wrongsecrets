=== Generating random values

Sometimes, we need to have a secret that is randomly generated at startup. Maybe you have encountered them already: applications that generate a password for first login and print that to standard out. One example is https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#unlocking-jenkins[Jenkins].

In this challenge, we will do the same thing: we randomly generate a secret at the startup of the application and log it to standard out. Can you find the answer?
How can we use this on the next startup ;-)?

Tip: take a look at the logging of the application at startup!
