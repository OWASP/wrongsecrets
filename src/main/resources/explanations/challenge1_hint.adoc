As the text of the challenge says, we are looking for a secret called `password` in the Java code. But how do we find it?

You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. When you have the source code available you can find hardcoded string simply by searching through the code. Grep can be used to help this process as it searches for patterns in large blocks of text. Use the below steps to find the answer:
- Access a terminal with https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html[*grep*] and https://git-scm.com/[*git*] installed.
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets`.
- Navigate to the Java code where the check for the right answer happens `cd src/main/java/org/owasp/wrongsecrets/`.
- Use grep recursively to look for the password string `grep -r password`.

2. An automated tool like https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[*Git-secrets*] can often help out. In this case it needs setting up with a specific rule:
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets`.
- Follow the instructions https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets[here] to install Git secrets.
- Add a new scan to look for the string `git secrets --add 'password\s*=\s*.+'`.
- Now execute that scan `git secrets --scan`.

3. When you do not have the source code available, try to obtain the actual application to reverse engineer it. The application, in this case, is a Jar file, which is a set of java class files together with a few resources.
- Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Jar file from the container's root to your local filesystem.
- open the JAR file in https://java-decompiler.github.io/[*JD-GUI*] or https://github.com/skylot/jadx[*jadx-gui*], now look for the `String password`!

4. You can scan the repository with https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog[*Trufflehog*].
- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets`.
- Follow the instructions https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog[here] to install Trufflehog.
- Follow these instructions to download the https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/blob/4afc224c635d10e732119f715f93788af1502ce4/examples/README.md[generic detector] file
- Download trufflehog generic detector `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/examples/generic.yml`.
- Scan the files using `trufflehog filesystem --config=$PWD/generic.yml . | grep password` and the password will be in the output.

5. Alternative, you can use the older Trufflehog 2:
- Have python and pip3 installed, and run `pip3 install trufflehog` to install Trufflehog 2.
- Scan the files using `trufflehog . | grep password` and the password will be in the output.
- Please note that Trufflehog 2 was released [> 5 years ago](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/tags?after=v3.0.0) and no longer [maintained](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/issues/2328).
