=== Spring Vault Template Injection

Vault template injection via agent injection typically involves injecting a sidecar container,
known as the Vault Agent, alongside your main application container.
The Vault Agent is responsible for interacting with HashiCorp Vault to retrieve secrets and inject them into the application's runtime environment.

Can you find secret injected into application environment?
