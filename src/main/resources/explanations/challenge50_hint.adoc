This challenge is specifically looking at a secret in a .NET8 binary

You can solve this challenge using the following alternative solutions:

1. Find the secrets with ILSpy.
- obtain the wrongsecrets-dotnet-<platform> binary, for this you can:
- retrieve it from the Docker image
- download it from the https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets-binaries/releases[Wrongsecrets Binaries]
- Install .NET8 and .NET8 SDK
- Install https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.ILSpyCmd[ilspycmd]
- optionally: Install `sfextract`: `dotnet tool install -g sfextract`
- Unpack the self-contained binary: `sfextract wrongsecrets-dotnet -o \./tmp`. or use ilspy: `mkdir tmp && ilspycmd -d wrongsecrets-dotnet-linux -o ~/tmp`
- Go to the tmp folder and do `ilspycmd dotnetproject.dll` to decompile the dll and find the secret.
