This challenge is specifically looking at a secret in a .NET8 binary

You can solve this challenge using the following alternative solutions:

1. Find the secrets with Ilsply.
- Install .NET8 and .NET8 SDK
- Install https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/tree/master/ICSharpCode.ILSpyCmd[ilspycmd]
- Install `sfextract`: `dotnet tool install -g sfextract`
- Unpack the self-contained binary: `sfextract wrongsecrets-dotnet -o \./tmp`.
- Go to the tmp folder and do `ilspycmd dotnetproject.dll` to decompile the dll and find the secret.
