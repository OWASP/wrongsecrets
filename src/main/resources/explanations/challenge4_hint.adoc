You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. Use `docker history`:
- Download the container,
- Run `docker history --no-trunc  jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>` with which you can find the arguments used for the container with the given tag.
- Now try finding the `ARG_BASED_PASSWORD` .

2. Visit the Docker-repository online:
- Go to the https://hub.docker.com/r/jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets[*WrongSecrets docker repo*]
- Take a look the tag relevant for you. There you can find all the commands used to compose the container. What is the value of `ARG_BASED_PASSWORD` ?

3. Use Dockle https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle[*Dockle*]:
- Install Dockle as described at its https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle[Github page]
- Run `dockle jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>` and use its output for your secrets hunt.

4. Exec into the container and dump the ENV-vars:
- Start the container locally with `docker run jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>`
- Find the container id by doing `docker ps` in a next terminal
- Do `docker exec -it <container id> sh`
- In the container do `env` .

5. Use `docker inspect` to find the ENV-vars:
- Download the container,
- Run `docker inspect jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>` and try to find the `Config` section and then the `Env` section. What is the value of `ARG_BASED_PASSWORD` ? Did you know if you use https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[JQ] you could use `docker inspect jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE> |  jq '.[] | .Config.Env[]' instead to find it much quicker?
