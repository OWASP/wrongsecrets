This challenge is specifically looking at a secret in a C binary

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Find the secrets with https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Install https://ghidra-sre.org/[Ghidra].
- Start it whit `ghidraRun`.
- Load the application `wrongsecrets-c` into ghidra by choosing a new project, then import the file and then doubleclick on it.
- Allow the Ghidra to analyze the application.
- Search for the secret: Go to `Functions` on the left-hand side, select `_secret` . Now on the screen on the right-hand side you can see the secret. This is a string in C.
- Search for the same secret, which is "hidden" as a char array: Go to `Functions` on the left-hand side, select `_secret2`. See that this returns a label on your right-hand side. Now open `Labels` on the left-hand side, select the label returned by `_secret2` (`_secret2.label`) and find the answer in the center. This is a Char array in C.

2. Find the secrets with https://www.radare.org[radare2].
- Install https://www.radare.org[radare2] with either `brew install radare2` on Mac or follow these steps: `git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2; cd radare2 ; sys/install.sh`
- Launch r2 analysis with `$ r2 -A wrongsecrets-c`
- Filter functions by term `secret` using afl: `afl~secret`, get the list of functions
- Use command `pdf @ sym._secret` to see disassembled output of function which returns secret
- Use command `pdf @ sym._secret2` to see disassembled output of function which returns secret2
