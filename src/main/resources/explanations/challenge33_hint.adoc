This challenge can be solved by looking at the metadata of the secret:

1. looking at it through code
- locate the secret definition in git (Challenge33.yml)
- find the secret value in the metadata.
2. looking at it through getting the secret
- connect to the k8s cluster with kubectl
- call `kubectl get secret challenge33 -o yaml` to get all the required data.
- Find the secret value in the metadata.
3. misuse debugging when listing all secrets
- connect to the k8s cluster with kubectl
- call `kubectl get secrets -v9` to get all the required data
- Find the secret value in the metadata.
