This challenge is specifically looking at MD5 and SHA1 hashes without salting. Are these un-crackable?

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. For the first hash (MD5):
- Use a tool such as Hashcat:
- Install https://hashcat.net/hashcat/[Hashcat]
- Download the https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt[rockyou.txt password list]
- Run Hashcat on the hash `hashcat -m 0 "2ab96390c7dbe3439de74d0c9b0b1767" /path/to/file/rockyou.txt`

2. For the second hash (SHA1):
- Use a tool such as Hashcat:
- Install https://hashcat.net/hashcat/[Hashcat]
- Download the https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt[rockyou.txt password list]
- Run Hashcat on the hash `hashcat -m 100 "F3BBBD66A63D4BF1747940578EC3D0103530E21D" /path/to/file/rockyou.txt`

3. For either of the hashes:
- Use an online hash cracking service to do the heavy lifting for you:
- Visit `https://crackstation.net/`
- Enter the hash and click "Crack Hashes"
