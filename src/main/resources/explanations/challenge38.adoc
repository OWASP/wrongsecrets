=== Git Notes

Git commit messages can be a constant pain point.

It is fine to use a short message, unintelligible garble or a simple mash of the keyboard in a git message until you have the unfortunate task of reviewing. At this point these scruffy messages can be a nightmare.

Git notes are here to solve this, it has been around for a long while but often gets overlooked. Add extra metadata about the commit without affecting the commit message itself.

Like all Git, once information is committed, it is very very hard to remove all reference of it. What could possible go wrong?
