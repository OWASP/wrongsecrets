This challenge can be solved using the following ways:

- Use the container itself:

  1. Clone the repository containing the challenge files:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets.git
     cd wrongsecrets
     ```

  2. Locate the `docker-create.sh` file in the repository. This file contains the build logic used by Acme Inc. to create the Docker container.

  3. Build the Docker image by running the `docker-create.sh` script:
     ```
     ./docker-create.sh
     ```

  4. Start the Docker container using the built image to access its environment:
     ```
     docker run -it jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:local-test-no-vault sh
     ```

  5. Investigate the container filesystem to locate the secret file:
     ```
     / $ cat var/run/secrets2/secret.txt
     ```

  6. The content of the `secret.txt` file is your answer.

- Find the secret in the buildx script:

1. Clone the repository containing the challenge files:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets.git
     cd wrongsecrets
     ```
2. Locate the `docker-create.sh` file in the repository. This file contains the build logic used by Acme Inc. to create the Docker container.

3. You can find the Hardcoded secret injected in the container `$SECRET_VALUE` in `create_containers` function


The misconfiguration demonstrates how secrets, passed securely during the Docker build process using `--secret`, can become exposed when improperly stored in the container. Your findings will help Acme Inc. understand and fix this critical issue.
