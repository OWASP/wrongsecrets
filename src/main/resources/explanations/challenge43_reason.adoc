*Why should we not share a secret on social media?*

Sharing a secret to your application on social media is a really bad practice because it then becomes publicly available for anyone to abuse,
if they learn about the context in which the secret is used.

Even otherwise, though comments/posts can be deleted on the user's end, the secret almost always ends up in some database that could get leaked.

Never share any secrets, personal or work related, on social media!
