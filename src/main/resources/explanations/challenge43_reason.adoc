*Why should we not share a secret on social media?*

Sharing a secret from your application on social media is a really bad practice because it becomes publicly available for anyone to abuse if they learn about the context in which the secret is used.

Although the user or platform can often delete comments/posts, the secret almost always ends up in some database that could get leaked.

Never share any secrets, personal or work-related, on social media!
