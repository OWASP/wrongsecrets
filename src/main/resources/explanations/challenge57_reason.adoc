=== What went wrong?

The application demonstrates several critical security mistakes commonly found in real-world applications:

**1. Embedded Credentials in Connection Strings**
The database connection string contains the username and password directly embedded:
```
jdbc:postgresql://db.example.com:5432/userdb?user=dbadmin&password=SuperSecretDB2024!&ssl=true
```

**2. Poor Error Handling**
When the database connection fails, the application exposes the entire connection string in the error message, revealing the embedded credentials to anyone who can see the error.

**3. Sensitive Information in Logs**
The error gets logged with the full connection string, meaning the credentials are now stored in log files that may be:
- Accessible to multiple team members
- Shipped to centralized logging systems
- Stored long-term in log archives
- Exposed through log monitoring tools

**4. No Secret Sanitization**
The application doesn't sanitize sensitive information before logging or displaying errors.

**How to fix this:**

1. **Use external secret management:** Store database credentials in environment variables, secret management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault), or configuration files not checked into version control.

2. **Separate connection parameters:** Keep the connection URL separate from credentials:
   ```
   DB_HOST=db.example.com
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=userdb
   DB_USER=dbadmin
   DB_PASS=SuperSecretDB2024!
   ```

3. **Implement proper error handling:** Sanitize error messages before logging or displaying them. Never include connection strings or other sensitive data in error messages.

4. **Use connection pooling with secure configuration:** Modern frameworks like Spring Boot support secure configuration of connection pools without exposing credentials.

5. **Monitor and audit:** Regularly review logs and error messages to ensure sensitive information isn't being inadvertently exposed.

This type of credential exposure is extremely common in production applications and represents one of the most frequent ways database credentials are accidentally leaked.
