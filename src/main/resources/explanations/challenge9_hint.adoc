You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. Dig through terraform.tfstate with Trufflehog:
- After you have build the infrastructure following the instructions in the README of the `aws` folder, stay in that folder and run `trufflehog3 --output=terraform-infra.json --format=json .`
- Now, open the terraform-infra.json file and start looking for the password.

2. Find the secret in AWS Secrets Manager (this is the cheap way, try the other ones :) )
- login to the AWS  https://console.aws.com/[Console] with the account with which you created the WrongSecrets setup.
- go to the AWS Secrets manager
- get the data from wrongsecrets1

3. Find the secret by exec-ing into the POD
- Make sure you have Kubectl installed as defined in the README.MD & make sure kubectl is configured to send commands to the right cluster.
- now do `kubectl get pods`. Here you see all the Pods active in the namespace you are in, which is for this app normally `default` (unless otherwise specified by your administrator/trainer).
- now for your instance of the WrongSecrets pod, do `kubectl exec -it secret-challenge-<rest of the name of the pod from the prev.step> -- sh`.
- now examinate the data which you can find in `/mnt/secrets-store`
