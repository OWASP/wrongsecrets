=== Reddit Blunder

Years ago, an error made by Microsoft developers in the way they set up the testing and debugging of the Windows 10 OS meant users could install
any OS of their choice on Windows PCs and mobile devices. This was called Microsoft's 'golden key' blunder.

Similarly, a developer in the OWASP community who also happened to be an active redditor, left a secret on the platform 'by mistake'.

Can you find the secret?
