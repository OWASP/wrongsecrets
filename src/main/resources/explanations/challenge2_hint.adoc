As the text of the challenges is saying: we are looking for a secret in the configuration of the Spring Boot application, with the name `Application.properties`.
You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. Use https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[*Trufflehog*]:
- Read up on the instructions of the tool at https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog[Trufflehog] and install it using `pip install truffleHog` or use its docker container.
- Now run Trufflehog at our repository: `trufflehog https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets`. Can you find the value of `password` in the output?

2. Inspect the `Application.properties` in the src/resources folder:
- Just open the `Application.properties` file in the `src/resources` folder at https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets[*the target repo*] and take a look. Can you find the secret?

3. When you do not have the sourcecode available:
- Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Jar file from the root of the container to your local filesystem.
- Open the JAR file in https://java-decompiler.github.io/[*JD-GUI*] or https://github.com/skylot/jadx[*jadx-gui*], find the `application.properties` in  `Resources/BOOT-INF` now look for a password!
