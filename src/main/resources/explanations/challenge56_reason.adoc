*Why you should check documentation for secrets*

Documentation and specification files are often shared widely and may be overlooked during security reviews.
Sometimes, secrets or sensitive information are added as examples or instructions and are not removed before sharing or publishing.
This challenge highlights the importance of reviewing all project files—including documentation—for secrets and sensitive data.

----

In a real project, you should always include explicit security requirements in your project specification or agentic plan. This means:
- Listing how secrets should be managed, stored, and rotated.
- Defining who has access to sensitive files and how access is controlled.
- Stating which tools or processes must be used to scan for secrets in all files, including documentation.
- Requiring regular reviews of both code and documentation for accidental secret leakage.

Adding these requirements helps ensure that security is considered from the start and reduces the risk of sensitive data exposure through overlooked files or bad practices.

[NOTE]
====
In real projects, always include security instructions on:
- TLS/SSL usage for all network communications
- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Regular dependency and vulnerability scanning
- Logging and monitoring for suspicious activity
- Using the right model and language for the right problem

These practices are essential for protecting your application and its data.
