You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. Find the bot token in the source code
- Look at the Challenge60 class in the source code
- Find the encoded bot token in the `getBotToken()` method
- Decode the Base64-encoded string (it's double-encoded)
- The token format is: `BOTID:TOKEN_STRING`

2. Use the bot token to access the Telegram channel
- The bot token can be used with the Telegram Bot API
- Visit https://t.me/WrongsecretsBot to see the channel
- Look for messages in the channel that contain the secret
- For this challenge, the secret is: `telegram_secret_found_in_channel`

3. Analyze the code structure
- The challenge follows the same pattern as other social media challenges
- Check how the `getTelegramSecret()` method works
- Look for hardcoded return values that represent the expected answer
