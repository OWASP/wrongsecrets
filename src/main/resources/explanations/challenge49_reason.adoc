*Why Using MD5 as a KDF is Bad*

Protecting keys effectively is crucial, and this means using the right Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) with additional entropy and contextual binding, as emphasized in the https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/0x04g-Testing-Cryptography/#weak-key-generation-functions[Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG).]

MD5 is too fast and easy to compute, enabling attackers to quickly try a vast number of inputs (like PINs) to derive the key. Additionally (although a bit harder to exploit), the collision space is relatively small, meaning multiple different inputs can lead to the same md5 hash.

Stronger KDFs are crucial when dealing with sensitive data, as they provide much-needed resistance against brute-force attacks and protect secrets even if the attacker gains access to partial information.

The MSTG recommends using robust KDFs like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or Argon2, which incorporate additional entropy and enforce computational hardness, making brute-force attacks more costly.
