=== Find the Slack API Token

Welcome to this challenge that demonstrates the vulnerability of hardcoded Slack API tokens in environment variables!

This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where:

1. **Slack API tokens are stored as environment variables** for application integration
2. **The tokens are obfuscated** to avoid detection by secret scanning tools 
3. **Employee turnover risk**: When an employee leaves, the token may not be rotated, allowing continued access

==== Your Mission

In this scenario, a developer has stored a Slack API token as an environment variable `CHALLENGE59_SLACK_TOKEN`. The token has been obfuscated using double base64 encoding to bypass Slack's secret scanning detection.

Your task is to:

1. Find the obfuscated Slack API token in the environment variable
2. Deobfuscate it to reveal the original token
3. Submit the deobfuscated token as your answer

==== Real-World Impact

This vulnerability demonstrates why:

- Hardcoded secrets in environment variables are risky
- Obfuscation is not a security measure
- API tokens should be rotated when employees leave
- Proper secrets management solutions should be used

==== Educational Note

In production environments:
- Use proper secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
- Implement token rotation policies
- Monitor API token usage
- Revoke access immediately when employees leave
- Never obfuscate secrets as a security measure
