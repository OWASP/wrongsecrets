=== Find the Slack Webhook URL

Welcome to this challenge that demonstrates the vulnerability of hardcoded Slack webhook URLs in environment variables!

This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where:

1. **Slack webhook URLs are stored as environment variables** for application notifications
2. **The URLs are obfuscated** to avoid detection by secret scanning tools
3. **Employee turnover risk**: When an employee leaves, the webhook may not be rotated, allowing continued access

==== Your Mission

In this scenario, a developer has stored a Slack webhook URL as an environment variable `CHALLENGE59_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`. The URL has been obfuscated using double base64 encoding to bypass Slack's secret scanning detection.

Your task is to:

1. Find the obfuscated Slack webhook URL in the environment variable
2. Deobfuscate it to reveal the original URL
3. Submit the deobfuscated webhook URL as your answer

==== Real-World Impact

This vulnerability demonstrates the specific risks of exposed Slack webhook URLs:

- **Unauthorized message posting**: Attackers can send malicious messages to your Slack channels
- **Social engineering attacks**: Fake announcements or phishing attempts via trusted channels
- **Information disclosure**: Sensitive channel names and workspace information revealed
- **Reputation damage**: Spam or inappropriate content posted under your organization's name
- **Obfuscation is not security**: Base64 encoding provides no real protection
- **Webhook persistence**: Unlike tokens, webhooks may remain active for extended periods

==== Educational Note

In production environments:
- Use proper secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault)
- Implement webhook rotation policies when employees leave
- Monitor webhook usage and establish alerts for unusual activity
- Revoke and regenerate webhooks immediately when employees leave
- Never obfuscate secrets as a security measure
- Consider using webhook signing secrets for additional validation
