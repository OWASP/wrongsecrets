You can solve this challenge by the following steps:

1. Exec into the container and go over the files:
- First check the actual Dockerfile and see what COPY operations happen. Note that you can get this data using `docker history` (see challenge 3&4 as well) when you have no Dockerfile but only an image.
- Start the container locally with `docker run jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<TAGNAME-HERE>`
- Find the container id by doing `docker ps` in a next terminal
- Do `docker exec -it <container id> "/bin/sh"`
- In the container, go to target directory of the COPY operation and look for the secret.
2. Use https://github.com/deepfence/SecretScanner[Deepfence secret scanner]
- Download the target version of the wrongsecrets container: `docker pull jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<VERSION YOU ARE PLAYING-HERE>`
- Run `docker run -it --rm --name=deepfence-secretscanner -v $(pwd):/home/deepfence/output -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker deepfenceio/secretscanning -image-name jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<VERSION YOU ARE PLAYING-HERE>`
