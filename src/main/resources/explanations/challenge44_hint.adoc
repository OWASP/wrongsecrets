This challenge can be solved using the following steps:

1. Find the secret with the commandline
- use `kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault -- vault kv metadata get -mount=secret wrongsecret` take a look at the metadata: do you see a map with a `secret`? that's the value you need to enter


2. Find the Secret in Vault using the logged root token:
- When you setup the K8s environment, the script tells you the value of the root token as below:

    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                s.Jqka4lSy8ayQw2LFsvyAgnTI
    token_accessor       HEr9RYa3OcZNDOHeFRXIMYCV
    token_duration       âˆž
    token_renewable      false
    token_policies       ["root"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["root"]


-  Use the token to login into Vault exposed at port 8200
-  Take a look around: can you find the location of the secret in the secrets overview?

3. Find the secret as the SRE member
- go to the vault web interface
- login with in with username "helper" and password "foo"
- find the actual secret.
