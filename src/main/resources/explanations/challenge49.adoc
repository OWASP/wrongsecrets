=== Cracking AES Encryption with a Weak MD5 Key

Imagine you're a security analyst investigating a mobile app that handles sensitive information. You discover that the developer is using AES encryption to protect a secret, but instead of using a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF), they rely on the insecure MD5 algorithm to derive encryption keys from a simple numeric PIN.

Youâ€™ve obtained an encrypted string: `k800mdwu8vlQoqeAgRMHDQ==`. You know that this string, when decrypted, reveals the text `the answer`.

The key used for AES encryption is derived by taking the MD5 hash of a PIN, which is a number between 0 and 99999. Your task is to find the correct PIN that was used to derive the encryption key and decrypt the secret.

Can you figure out the correct PIN and unlock the secret?
