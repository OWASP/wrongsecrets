You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

1. Get the secret from older commits using Trufflehog
- install https://github.com/feeltheajf/trufflehog3[trufflehog3] by running `pip3 install trufflehog3` which requires python3 and pip to be installed
- run `trufflehog3 https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets` and take a look at the output: you should find 3 `aws_secret_access_key` one of them is the solution!
2. Get the secret by "using the encryption" of the challenge as the encrypted materials are still in the java class (Note this is a more advanced test and requires some java skills).
- Find the container which is used to offer this challenge to you
- Extract the ciphertext for Challenge15
- Clone the project locally and run it locally following the instructions at the https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets#notes-on-development[Readme.md].
- https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-your-first-java-application.html[Debug] the project, by setting a breakpoint at the beginning of the `quickDecrypt` method.
- Override the cipherText value with the ciphertext you extracted at step 2, and now find the plaintext.
