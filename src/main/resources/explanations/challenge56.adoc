=== Challenge 56: Find the Secret in the Project Specification

In this challenge, your task is to find a secret that has been hidden in the project's agentic plan documentation file: https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/blob/master/cursor/rules/project-specification.mdc#L131[`cursor/rules/project-specification.mdc`].

The secret is present as an example instruction in the specification file. Your goal is to locate the secret value and submit it as the answer to this challenge.

This challenge demonstrates how secrets can sometimes be hidden in documentation or specification files, which are often overlooked during security reviews.
