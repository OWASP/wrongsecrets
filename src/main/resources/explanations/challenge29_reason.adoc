*Why posting screenshots of logs in a GitHub issue is a bad idea*

You shouldn't post screenshots of logs in a GitHub issue because:
1. Data is public (even on a private repository, often more public than you'd hope)
2. Screenshots can't be redacted like text. Even when the secret is blurred, this can be reversible.

Check for any secret leaks in the output and leverage code block markdown to post logs in a GitHub issue. This is also much nicer for the maintainers trying to help you debug :).
