This challenge can be solved using the following steps:

1. Run `kubectl get pods -A` and find secret-challenge-xxx pod name

2. Run `kubectl exec secret-challenge-xxx -c secret-challenge -n default -- cat vault/secrets/challenge46` where `xxx` is the rest of the randomly generated pod name to print the hardcoded value used by the developer.

Note: if you are running this on a hosted environment, where you do not have access to the Kubernetes cluster, ask the organizer of the hosted solution to execute the commands for you and return the results.
