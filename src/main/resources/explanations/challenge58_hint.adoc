=== Hint for Challenge 58

This challenge demonstrates a very common security anti-pattern: **database connection strings with embedded credentials that leak through error messages**.

**Where to look:**

1. **Try the error endpoint:** Visit `/error-demo/database-connection` to trigger a database connection failure
2. **Check the response:** The application will attempt to connect to a database and fail, exposing the connection string
3. **Look at logs:** The application also logs the error with the exposed credentials

**What to look for:**

- JDBC connection URLs often contain sensitive information
- Look for patterns like `jdbc:postgresql://...?user=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD`
- The error message will show the full connection string when the database connection fails

**Real-world context:**

This is one of the most common ways secrets leak in production:
- Database connection failures during application startup
- Health check failures in container orchestration
- Development environments with verbose error reporting
- CI/CD pipelines where database connections fail

**Remember:** The goal is to find the database password that gets exposed in the error message when the connection fails.
