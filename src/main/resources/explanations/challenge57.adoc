=== LLM API Key Exposure in Client-Side JavaScript

As AI and Large Language Model (LLM) integrations become increasingly popular in web applications, a new class of security vulnerabilities has emerged: **LLM API key exposure in client-side code**. This challenge demonstrates one of the most dangerous mistakes developers make when building AI-powered applications.

This challenge simulates a scenario where a developer:

1. **Embeds LLM API keys directly in client-side JavaScript** instead of using server-side proxy endpoints
2. **Exposes sensitive API credentials** to anyone who can view the source code
3. **Logs API keys in browser console** for debugging purposes
4. **Makes API keys accessible** to browser extensions, XSS attacks, and web scraping

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

- **Financial Impact:** Exposed LLM API keys can be used by attackers to make expensive API calls, leading to huge bills
- **Rate Limit Abuse:** Attackers can exhaust your API quotas, causing service disruptions
- **Data Extraction:** Malicious actors can use your API keys to extract training data or perform reconnaissance
- **Brand Damage:** Unauthorized use of your API keys can be associated with malicious activities

**Common Real-World Scenarios:**

- Chat applications that call OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google AI APIs directly from the browser
- JavaScript code that includes API keys for development convenience
- Single-page applications (SPAs) with hardcoded credentials
- Debug console logs that accidentally expose API keys
- Source maps that reveal API keys from minified code

**How to Explore:**

1. Visit `/llm-demo` to see the vulnerable chat application
2. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
3. Look for exposed API keys in the JavaScript source code
4. Check the Console tab for any logged credentials
5. Examine the Network tab to see how API keys are transmitted

Can you find the exposed LLM API key that would allow unauthorized access to the AI service?

**Hint:** The secret you're looking for starts with "sk-" and is a typical OpenAI-style API key format.
