=== JavaScript-based In-Browser LLM Challenge

This challenge features a simple AI assistant running directly in your browser. The AI has been given specific instructions and contains a hidden secret that you need to discover.

The AI assistant simulates a Large Language Model (LLM) with a system prompt that contains sensitive information. Your task is to use various prompt injection techniques to extract the hidden secret from the AI's instructions.

**Your Mission:**
Try different approaches to make the AI reveal its hidden instructions or secret information. Some techniques you might explore:

- Direct questioning about secrets or hidden information
- Asking about the AI's system prompt or instructions  
- Using prompt injection techniques to bypass safety measures
- Social engineering the AI to reveal protected information

**What to look for:**
The secret is embedded in the AI's system instructions. You'll need to craft your questions carefully to get the AI to reveal information it's supposed to keep hidden.

**Security Context:**
This challenge demonstrates real-world vulnerabilities in AI systems where:
- Sensitive information might be embedded in system prompts
- AI models can be manipulated through carefully crafted inputs
- Prompt injection attacks can bypass AI safety measures
- System instructions might contain secrets that should never be exposed

Try interacting with the AI assistant above and see if you can discover the hidden secret!
