=== Challenge 12: Docker COPY and WORKDIR

Often, wen convenience containers are made, large parts of the local filesystem of the creator are being copied so that they are available to the author of the convenience container.

In this challenge, we did some COPY as well for you and hid a key there. Given that the key changes on every generation of the docker container, you better look around quickly.
