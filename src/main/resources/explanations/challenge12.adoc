=== Challenge 12: Docker COPY and WORKDIR

Sometimes large parts of the local filesystem are copied over to the container so that they are available in the container for the convenience of the author.

In this challenge, we did some COPY as well for you and hid a key there. Given that the key changes on every generation of the docker container, you better look around quickly.

Try https://github.com/deepfence/SecretScanner[*deepfenceio/secretscanning*], `docker inspect` of the image, or just `docker exec` against a running container.
