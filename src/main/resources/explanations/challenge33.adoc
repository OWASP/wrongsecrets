=== Kubernetes StringData or Data?

Kubernetes has 2 types of fields for data in a secret. The `StringData` contains the plaintext data, while the `Data` contains the base64 encoded value.
So what if you want to swap the StringData value to a Data value in order to secure it further?
You don't have to, as long as you have set up RBAC correctly. After all: both values should not be visible when a secret is listed or described. But what if you move from standard to sealed secrets but don't migrate all of them?
Then it might be good to know that the metadata might contain the actual value of the StringData.
Can you find the secret?
