=== What's wrong?

Hardcoding Telegram bot credentials in source code is a serious security vulnerability:

**Security Issues:**
1. **Exposed API Credentials**: Bot tokens provide full access to the Telegram bot functionality
2. **Channel Compromise**: Anyone with the token can read messages, send messages, and potentially access private information
3. **Source Code Exposure**: Credentials are visible to anyone with access to the codebase
4. **Version Control History**: Tokens remain in git history even if later removed

**Real-world Impact:**
- Attackers can use bot tokens to send spam or malicious messages
- Sensitive information shared in channels becomes accessible to unauthorized users
- Bot functionality can be hijacked for malicious purposes
- Compliance violations if the bot handles personal or sensitive data

**How to fix:**
1. **Environment Variables**: Store bot tokens in environment variables or secure configuration files
2. **Secret Management**: Use dedicated secret management services (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
3. **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate bot tokens and revoke old ones
4. **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls for who can access bot credentials
5. **Code Reviews**: Always review code for hardcoded secrets before committing

**Detection:**
- Use secret scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline
- Implement pre-commit hooks to catch hardcoded credentials
- Regular security audits of codebase
- Monitor for unexpected bot activity
