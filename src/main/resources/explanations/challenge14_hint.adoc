You can solve this challenge by the following alternative solutions:

Note this challenge requires you to install https://www.keepassx.org/[Keepass(X)] on your system to open the kdbx file. alternatively you can use the https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets?tab=readme-ov-file#want-to-play-but-are-not-allowed-to-install-the-tools[WrongSecrets Deskop] to solve the challenge.

1. Get the Keepass file from the Docker container and open it.
 - take a look at the Dockerfile to see where the KeePass file has been copied to.
 - Follow the instructions of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/[the Docker documentation] to copy the Keepass file from the container's root to your local filesystem.
- Open the file using KeepassX. A password prompt will show.
- First, check the code of `Challenge14.java` in https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/main/java/org/owasp/wrongsecrets/challenges/docker/Challenge14.java[github] to see where the password might be stored. Then open the `Application.properties` file in the `src/resources` folder at https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets[*the target repo*]  and take a look at the property holding the KeePass password.
- Now, use the password you found to open the Keepass file. The content should allow you to find credentials to Alibaba Cloud. That's the answer!
2. Get the Keepass file from the test resources: we were silly enough to put the same file in `src/test/resources/alibabacreds.kdbx` so you can open that ass well.
 - Check out the project using git and open the file, or get it from https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/test/resources/alibabacreds.kdbx[Github]
 - Open the file using KeepassX. A password prompt will show.
 - First, check the code of `Challenge14.java` in https://github.com/OWASP/wrongsecrets/blob/master/src/main/java/org/owasp/wrongsecrets/challenges/docker/Challenge14.java[github] to see where the password might be stored.
