As the challenge states you need to look for Bash commands that have been executed in the past; what command will give us this?

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Use `bash` within the container to access the history and find the secret:
- Access the bash shell of the container, this can be done with `docker exec -it jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<version> bash` (Replace `<version> with the version of the container you want to use).
- Type `history` to list the commands that have been used within the container
2. Print contents of any .bash_history file within a running container:
- Start the container with `docker run -it --entrypoint bash jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<version>` (Replace `<version> with the version of the container you want to use)
- cat the contents of the file: `cat ~/.bash_history`. Once you have this file you can use grep or any other search tool to narrow down the answer.
