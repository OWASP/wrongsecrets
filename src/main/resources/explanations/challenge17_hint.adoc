As the challenge states you need to look for Bash commands that have been executed in the past; what command will give us this?

You can solve this challenge using the following steps:

1. Print contents of any .bash_history file within a running container:
- Start the container with `docker run -it --entrypoint sh jeroenwillemsen/wrongsecrets:<version>` (Replace `<version> with the version of the container you want to use)
- cat the contents of the file: `cat ~/.bash_history`. Once you have this file you can use grep or any other search tool to narrow down the answer.
