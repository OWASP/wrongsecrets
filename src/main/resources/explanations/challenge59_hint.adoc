=== Hint for Challenge 59

Looking for the Slack webhook URL? Here are some hints to get you started:

==== Where to Look

1. **Environment Variables**: The webhook URL is stored in an environment variable called `CHALLENGE59_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
2. **Check the Application**: You can inspect environment variables through the application or container

==== Deobfuscation Process

The webhook URL has been obfuscated using a common technique:

1. **Double Base64 Encoding**: The original URL has been base64 encoded twice
2. **Process**: Original → Base64 → Base64 again
3. **To decode**: Reverse the process (decode base64 twice)

==== What You're Looking For

- Slack webhook URLs follow the pattern: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/...`
- They contain three path segments after `/services/`
- Example format: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T123456789/B123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx`
- The URL segments represent: Team ID / Channel ID / Secret Token

==== Tools You Can Use

- **Base64 decoder**: Any online base64 decoder or command line tools
- **Command line**: `echo "encoded_string" | base64 -d`
- **Browser console**: `atob("encoded_string")` in JavaScript

==== Security Learning

This challenge teaches you about webhook-specific risks:
- How attackers can find obfuscated webhook URLs
- Why webhook URLs are sensitive credentials that need protection
- The potential for unauthorized message posting and social engineering
- Risk of hardcoded webhook URLs in environment variables
- How exposed webhooks can lead to reputation damage and information disclosure
