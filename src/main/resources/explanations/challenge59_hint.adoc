=== Hint for Challenge 59

Looking for the Slack API token? Here are some hints to get you started:

==== Where to Look

1. **Environment Variables**: The token is stored in an environment variable called `CHALLENGE59_SLACK_TOKEN`
2. **Check the Application**: You can inspect environment variables through the application or container

==== Deobfuscation Process

The token has been obfuscated using a common technique:

1. **Double Base64 Encoding**: The original token has been base64 encoded twice
2. **Process**: Original → Base64 → Base64 again
3. **To decode**: Reverse the process (decode base64 twice)

==== What You're Looking For

- Slack API tokens typically start with `xoxb-` for bot tokens
- They follow the pattern: `xoxb-numbers-numbers-letters`
- Example format: `xoxb-1234567890-1234567890-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx`

==== Tools You Can Use

- **Base64 decoder**: Any online base64 decoder or command line tools
- **Command line**: `echo "encoded_string" | base64 -d`
- **Browser console**: `atob("encoded_string")` in JavaScript

==== Security Learning

This challenge teaches you:
- How attackers find obfuscated secrets
- Why obfuscation is not encryption
- The importance of proper secrets management
- Risk of hardcoded tokens in environment variables
