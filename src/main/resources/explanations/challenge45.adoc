=== Vault subkey challenge

Sometimes, all you want to do is have that concise entry in your secrets management system. So, what about storing your username and password in the same entry?
We tried doing that but got into a new problem! With Hashicorp Vault, you can set up policies to allow access to a subkey (Which is the key to the value of your secret). Can you find the very random username we set up for this challenge?
