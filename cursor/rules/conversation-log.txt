User: can you make this part of the project-specifications todo?
Assistant: Added a TODO section for test coverage improvements to project-specification.mdc.

User: @wrong-secrets-configuration.yaml can you add an entry for challenge56?
Assistant: Added Challenge56 to wrong-secrets-configuration.yaml with all required fields.
